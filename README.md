## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### Useful resources

- [MDN JavaScript Guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript) - This helped me to learn javaScript and become more confident and actually be able to write my own code without looking anywhere first and also to know what javaScript is all about.
- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com) - This amazing resource helped me learn CSS and HTML without actually paying anything and there are also guides and references to other languages there.  I'd recommend it to anyone still learning any of these concepts.
